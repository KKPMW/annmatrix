Package: annmatrix
==================

Version 0.1.3 [TBD]

BUG FIXES:

 * 'rbind() and cbind()' no longer treat 'deparse.level' argument as another element.
 * 'cbind(X, Y)' when X is 'annmatrix' and Y is a regular matrix now works without errors.
 * Single argument operators like '!X' and '-X' now work on 'annmatrix' objects without errors.
 * 'as.annmatrix(X)' no longer removes existing row and column annotations when X is 'annmatrix'.


Version 0.1.2 [2023-05-14]

BUG FIXES:

 * The class of 'annmatrix' objects now also include "matrix" and "array" fixing a bug where matrix-generic methods like unique() treated annmatrix like a vector.
 * 'stack(X)' now works without errors when X contains duplicated row names and/or duplicated column names.

NEW FEATURES:

 * 'scale()' now preserves the annmatrix class.
 * 'rbind()' and 'cbind()' now preserve the annmatrix class and combine annotations.

CHANGES:

 * annmatrix() constructor no longer tries to set celver annotation names when 'rann' and 'cann' arguments are passed as vectors.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added information about return values for all .Rd files (as requested for submission to CRAN).

INTERNAL:

 * Added unit tests for annmatrix constructor


Version: 0.1.1 [2023-05-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * 'as.annmatrix()' converts various objects to 'annmatrix' (for now only works on matrices).
 * 'stack()' turns annmatrix object into a long format data frame.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Simplified the documentation of 'help(annmatrix)' by moving conversion and subsetting methods to another place.
